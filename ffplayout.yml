general:
    helptext: Sometimes it can happen, that a file is corrupt but still playable,
        this can produce an streaming error over all following files. The only way
        in this case is, to stop ffplayout and start it again. Here we only say when
        it stops, the starting process is in your hand. Best way is a systemd service
        on linux. 'stop_threshold' stop ffplayout, if it is async in time above this
        value. A number below 3 can cause unexpected errors.
    stop_threshold: 11
