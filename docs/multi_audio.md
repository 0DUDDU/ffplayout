## Multiple Audio Tracks

**\* This is a experimental feature, used it with caution!**

With _ffplayout_ you can output streams with multiple audio tracks, with some limitations:
* **Not all formats support multiple audio tracks. For example _flv/rtmp_ doesn't support it.**
* In your output parameters you need to set the correct mapping.
