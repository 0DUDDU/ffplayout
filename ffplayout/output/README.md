## Outputs
ffplayout has a modularized output system, which mean you can write your own output function. Just create a python file in this folder with an **output()** function in it. In this function you ca do what ever you want. Use the other output files as references.

#### Activating Output
To use one of the outputs you need to edit the **ffplayout.yml** config, here under **out** set your **mode** to the file name, without extension. if you need it feel free to extend the config to your needs.
